# Flappy Bird Autofarmer
Too lazy to grind TIX like me?

Use this to quickly and **very efficiently** farm TIX and earn upwards of ~**250,000** TIX per day assuming consistent farming. (24h)

## How-To Play
1. Actually play a **working PBB clone**. (Favorite: https://bronzeforever.net/play/)
2. Download & use a **working ROBLOX executor**. (Favorite: https://buyawp.gg/)
3. Manually grind your way up to **Anthian City**. (City for the 4th gym badge)
4. Go to the **Park region** and head into the **Golden Pokeball**. (You'll see it)
5. Make your way over to the **Arcade**, and locate the Flappy Owlet game. (Near the enterence, to the left)
6. Stand in view of the middle Machine, where the Play buttons are visible. (Easiest to play + Farm is designed for it)
7. Run the script & leave when you're done! (This is the only way to close the farmer)

## Script
Copy and paste the following script into your executor of choice and AFK!
> ```lua
> loadstring(game:HttpGet(
>   "https://github.com/Some-Cool-Stuffs/Flappy-Owlet-Auto-Player/blob/main/main.luau?raw=true"
> ))()
> ```

## Visuals
Here's a visual sample on what your game would actually look like when it's working.
